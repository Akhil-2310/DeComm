## What is it all about?
Web3 is a newer concept but is very useful. Though, the starting point for the same is pretty tough and therefore we need to change this. People are afraid to start using web3 in day to day life but we as an ecosystem, need to change this narrative and bring more and more people to web3 space. 

- How can we do it?

This can be done by bringing the most basic things like grocery, clothing, electronics onchain and even their fine art. Hence, I have built a ecommerce web-app, DeComm. When people will start buying day to day things and essentials onchain is where mass adoption takes place. DeComm is an ecommerce app where there is no centralization. It is not another nft marketplace where people can just buy and sell nfts but where people can list what products and also their art pieces they want to sell. People who want to buy and sell their product can buy and sell the products using the USDC stablecoin as stablecoins are the most prominent use case of  crypto. 

- How is the project made?

All the buying and listing of products is controlled by the smart contract. The interface is built using vite where users can list their products and it will appear on the marketplace. The buyers who want to buy the products can buy the same within seconds from the marketplace. The contract is deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia and Scroll Sepolia.


- Future Scope

Collaborating with delivery services to make the product reach the people's homes.
